        <h2 style="padding: 10px 50px;">
            As one of the more recent additions to the 
            DPS family, we come endowed with dynamic 
            experience, gleaned over fifty years. This 
            is largely the outcome of continuous 
            process of innovation, both, in teaching 
            methods as well as learning systems. 
            <br> <br>
            DPS, Vadodara emulates the banyan tree, 
            from which the city of Vadodara derives
             its name. The institution is to 
             provide the ultimate quintessence 
             under which our children will receive 
             the cool and conclusive environment for
             the growth of their body, mind and spirit.
            <br> <br>
            The aim of our school is to help children 
            acquire the values and skills essential for 
            their growth into complete human beings. 
            The school seeks to ensure that the children
             are able to develop their fullest potentials
              according to their unique natural ability.

        <h1 style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center;"><u>Trinity of The Learning Process in DPS Vadodara</u></h1>

        <h2 style="padding: 10px 50px;">
            For us at DPS Vadodara, there is a trinity 
            of the long process – the child, the teacher 
            and the parent. All three have separate 
            roles to play. While the journey through the 
            school years can be very enriching, the school 
            by itself cannot perform magic. For a child to
             come out with flying colours, the active
              participation of the teachers and the parents
            is mandatory. This is a pact sacrosanct to us
        </h2>

        <h1 style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center;"><u>Our Accomplished & Committed Faculty</u></h1>

        <h2 style="padding: 10px 50px;">
            Our faculty is a well – established team of 
            highly qualified professionals, who are committed 
            to challenging and guiding young minds. Their 
            complete dedication to the education of the 
            child is the testimony to our spirit and 
            sense of commitment. These gifted professionals
            not only teach, but also serve as advisors, 
            coaches and counselors. Wonderful mentors, 
            role models and friends. Our faculty is the 
            true pulse of the school.
